    "250 Hz: For most clinical EEG research, brain waves of interest typically fall between 0.5 and 40 Hz. Sampling at 256 Hz is more than sufficient to capture these frequencies, with a Nyquist frequency of 128 Hz (half of 256), which allows for capturing activity up to 128 Hz. "

    "500–1000 Hz: Higher sampling rates are preferred in research settings, particularly for studying rapid brain oscillations, epileptic spikes, or high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), which can occur above 80 Hz. This higher sampling rate provides finer temporal resolution, which is useful for accurate analysis and source localization of neural signals.\n",
